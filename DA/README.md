## Probability and Statistics:

### Counting (Permutations and Combinations)

To calculate permutations and combinations, you can use the following formulas:

- Permutations: The number of ways to arrange a set of objects in a specific order.
    - Formula: $(nPr = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!})$
    - Example: If you have 5 objects and you want to arrange them in groups of 3, the number of permutations would be $(5P3 = \frac{5!}{(5 - 3)!} = 60)$.

- Combinations: The number of ways to select a subset of objects from a larger set, without considering the order.
    - Formula: $(nCr = \frac{n!}{r! \cdot (n - r)!})$
    - Example: If you have 5 objects and you want to select 3 of them, the number of combinations would be $(5C3 = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot (5 - 3)!} = 10)$.
